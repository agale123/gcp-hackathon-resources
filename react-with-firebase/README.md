# react-with-firebase

This is a simple React app created with the create-react-app script
that gets the URL from an image in Firebase storage and displays it.

To run the app use the command `npm install` from the /demo directory
and then run `npm install firebase` to install dependencies and
`npm start` to run the local app server.
